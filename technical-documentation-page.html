            <p>the invention of the sauce or the name is possibly derived from three different sources- 'mahon', 'manier'(meaning to stir), and 'moyeu' (referred to the middle of the egg). mayonnaise is a cold emlusion sauce based on egg yolk. if it is not handled carefully, it will separate giving a curdled appreance. it constitutes of egg yolk, and vinegar or lemon juice. the key is to keep the ingredient at room temperature and not chilled. a cold bowl, or eggs taken straight from the refrigerator, will prevent the mayonnaise from thickening. this sauce is always served cold and thus forms a base for most of the salads and sandwich fillings. mayonnaise is generally  served as the dipping sauce with snacks.   </p>
